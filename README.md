# Sunflower Drought Experiment 2025Term2
 This is preliminary code for testing sunflower drought tolerance

 
#### CSV raw data
- Sunflowers_Data_Raw_Full_2025April07_byFarbod.csv (unfiltered)
- Farbod_raw_data.csv (just A and C)

#### TXT files:
- Treatment A and Control: TreamentAC_Biomass.txt
- Treatment B: TreatmentB_2025March12.txt

#### Code:
- Treatment A and Control: Drought_AC_Biomass_testing_code_2025Mar12.R
- Treatment B: Drought_B_wilt_testing_code_2025Mar12.R
- LMM 

#### Conclusion on biomass with LMM
Method: LMM method used
- Treatment A & Susceptible (base)
- Significant signal compared to C (C had higher biomass than A)
- NON significant compared to Resistant (R had slightly lower biomass than S)

#### Conclusion on days to wilt 
Method: Adjust number of days based on V-6 leaf length and then compare (2025 April 09 code)
- NON signficant in t-test between Resistant and Susceptible for days to first & full wilt
